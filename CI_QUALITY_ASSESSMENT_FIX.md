# CI Quality Assessment Fix Summary

## Issue
The CI workflow was failing with the error: "1 specific reference found, requires 2" despite the mock review content containing multiple specific references (line, function).

## Root Cause
The CI workflow was using `grep -c` to count pattern occurrences, which counts the number of **lines** containing matches, not the total number of matches. This caused undercounting when multiple patterns appeared on the same line.

## Solution
Updated `.github/workflows/rigorous-validation.yml` to use `grep -o | wc -l` instead of `grep -c` for consistent counting with the local validation scripts.

### Changes Made:
1. **Line 133**: Changed from `grep -c "line\|function\|メソッド\|行"` to `grep -o "line\|function\|メソッド\|行" | wc -l`
2. **Line 134**: Changed from `grep -c "改善\|実装\|追加\|見直し"` to `grep -o "改善\|実装\|追加\|見直し" | wc -l`

## Verification
The mock review content now correctly counts:
- **Specific references**: 2 (line, function)
- **Improvement suggestions**: 4 (改善, 実装, 見直し, 追加)
- **Character count**: 463

All thresholds are met:
- ✅ Character count >= 200
- ✅ Specific references >= 2
- ✅ Improvement suggestions >= 2

## Testing
All quality assessment tests pass:
```bash
cd test && bats test_quality_assessment_fix.bats
# Output: All 5 tests pass
```

The fix ensures consistency between local validation scripts and CI workflows, preventing false failures due to different counting methods.
